This project is in the early stages of active development.

Guildboard is a Django-based web application to solve my gym's leaderboard problem. We have a big dry-erase board on the wall to compare everyone's maxes. We're all social media addicts and would rather see this online, along with some way to record videos and pictures for training logs. There are a number of other features I'd like to throw in, but that will have to wait until this part is actually finished and works. (The federation handling falls under this category.) I've created a milestone with tickets for the features I hope to release as part of a beta version.
