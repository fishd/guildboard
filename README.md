This project is only about 1/3rd of the way implemented and is under active development. It's a little messy; there's no documentation; I intentionally skipped migrating the Bitbucket commit history because it was a bunch of ugly, large commits.

But it's the first time in my life that I've had a clear idea for a programming project, so I'm rolling with it. Hopefully, the potential for other humans to see this project will inspire me to create something polished and respectable.

Guildboard is a Django-based web application to solve my gym's leaderboard problem. We have a big dry-erase board on the wall to compare everyone's maxes. We're all social media addicts and would rather see this online, along with some way to record videos and pictures for training logs. There are a number of other features I'd like to throw in, but that will have to wait until this part is actually finished and works. (The federation handling falls under this category.)
